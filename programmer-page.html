        <p>
            Hello future employers, my name is wilmar Ferreiras.<br>
            During the pandemic of covid-19, I was first introduced to programming and immediately fell in love with it. <BR>
            The endless and wonderful things you can create with it, captivated me and till now I am still impressed by it.<BR>
            I have had the chance to work on a couple of projects on my own as well as with big and small companies.<BR>
            This page would display my experiences in coding with such companies and some of my own projects; one being the website you are on currently. <br>
            Hopefully we can contribute to each other's journey.
        </p>

            From Jan 2023 to june 2023, <br>
            I worked with NASA's Globe.gov website team as an intern.<br>
            While working with the team, I was fortunate enough to be taught HTML<br>
            As well as work on fixing bbuggy and unfinished HTML on the website.<br>
            I worked on tasks such as;<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating and replacing heading tags</i>
                <li>including alt text for screen readers</i>
                <li>Adding closing closing tags</i>
                <li>trouble shooting why tags were not working</i>
            </ul>

           From July 8 to Aug 16, I<br>
           had the great opportunity to work with the<br>
           Open Market team as an intern. An upcoming Emarket BIPOc<br>
           business, who are determine to make a difference across the world.
           In this internship, I used my python knowledge to create a
           webscrapper that would find BIPOC Sponsors for their upcoming business.
           As well as using my knowledge to recreate their website using HTML and css.
